## Briefly about myself

In 2016 I graduated from the Belarusian Radio Engineering University as a programmer, but in 2011 started my career as a layout designer and worked over 7 years in little companies and freelance in Belarus. I created websites using CMS Joomla and WordPress, worked with photoshop layouts and altered ready-made templates.

In 2018 I gave birth to my daughter, left programming and opened my own printing business. More than 4 years I worked as a designer in Photoshop creating holiday printing and studied marketing, blogging, PR and SMM. Since 2021 I have been working as a blogger on Instagram.

In 2022 we decided to move to live in Israel and I decided to resume my career as Frontend Developer, because I like to see the product that I create and I see great prospects in this direction. Now I am actively learning English, Hebrew and re-learning actual web development.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
